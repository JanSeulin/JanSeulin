# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Seulin, from SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. I'm currently in my journey to become a full stack web developer. I don't have much to show yet around here, but slow and steady I'll reach there!

## Projects
-  **Portfolio Website** [[Live Demo]](https://janseulin.github.io/portfolio-website/) - Simple portfolio website, currently under construction, as I'm focusing on having what to put there after all. I added only a couple of sections for now.
-  **Purple Ballad Minigame** [[Live Demo]](https://janseulin.github.io/purple-ballad--minigame/) - A reflex based game where your objective is to click on the purple rectangle on a grid as things gets faster and confusing.
