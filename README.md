# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Seulin, from SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student that aspires to become a full stack web developer. Here's the demonstrations of some of my personal projects:

## Projects
- **The Wired Hardware Store** [[Live Demo]](https://janseulin.github.io/TheWired/#/) A Hardware E-commerce mock-up website created with React. Not 100% functional, but it serves the initial practicing purpose. 
- **DeliverKing Website** [[Live Demo]](https://janseulin.github.io/delivery-website--mock-up/) - A mock-up website created with the purpose of practicing HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
-  **Portfolio Website** [[Live Demo]](https://janseulin.github.io/portfolio-website/) - Simple portfolio website, not final. I'll probably create a new one from scratch soon.
-  **Purple Ballad Minigame** [[Live Demo]](https://janseulin.github.io/purple-ballad--minigame/) - A reflex based game where your objective is to click on the purple rectangle on a grid as things gets faster and confusing.
