# Hello there! 👋

My name is Jan Seulin, from São Paulo - Brazil. I'm currently in my journey to become a full stack web developer. I don't have much to show yet around here, but slow and steady I'll reach there!

## Projects
- [Live Demo](https://janseulin.github.io/portfolio-website/) - **Portfolio Website** - Simple portfolio website, currently under construction, as I'm focusing on having what to put there after all. I added only a couple of sections for now.
- [Live Demo](https://janseulin.github.io/purple-ballad--minigame/) - **Purple Ballad Minigame** - A reflex based game where your objective is to click on the purple rectangle on a grid as things gets faster and confusing.
